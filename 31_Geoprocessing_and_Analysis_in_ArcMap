## Premise

We are interested at looking at access to daycare centers accross NYC. First, we want to evaluate if daycare centers are located in 
areas that have high numbers of children under 5 years old. Then we will evaluate which daycare centers are farthest from 
public transportation (subway stations).

## Questions

What percent of daycare centers are located within areas with a high number of children under five?
How many daycare centers are located farther than 1/4 mile away from a subway station? Where are those centers (borough, neighborhood)?
How many children do those "far" daycare centers serve?

## Before beginning

Download the data (same as previous week's lab, except Day Care Centers is a geocoded shapefile of the daycare centers as points):

* [Day Care Centers](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/DAYCARECENTERS_NYC_CLEAN.xlsx)
* [NYC_TRACTS_2010](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/2010Tracts-20191025T194412Z-001.zip). 
      **NOTE**: You will have to rename the layer as NYC_TRACTS_2010 in the Catalog window once you open ArcMap.
* [UnderFiveByTract](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/UnderFivePopulation.xls). **NOTE**: You may have to save this file as a CSV after downloading it.
* [Subway Stations] ()

Add the three shapefiles and the csv to the data frame/table of contents.

**Join** the `UnderFiveByTract` csv to the `NYC_TRACTS_2010` shapefile.

**Note:** Save your map project (as a .mxd) periodically.

# Finding daycares near concentrations of children under 5

How many daycares (or what percent of the total number of daycares) are located within census tracts where more than 15.5% of the population
are children under five years old?

* Navigate to menu `Selection` > `Select by Attributes`. Make sure the `TRACTS` layer is the active selection and the selection method is set to 
`Create a New Selection`. **Double-click** `UFiveP`, click `>`, and type `15.5`. Your expression should look like this:
`"UFiveP" > 15.5`. Click `OK`. In the bottom left-hand corner of the ArcMap window, you should see that 22 features were selected.

* Right-click on the TRACTS layer and choose `Selection` > `Create Layer from Selected Features`. A new layer will appear on top. Save (`Export`)
that new layer to your working directory as a shapefile called `NYC_tracts_kids`. Clear selection by navigating to menu item `Selection` > `Clear selected feautres`. 
Remove the duplicate TRACTS selection layer. Resymbolize the NYC_tracts_kids layer so that you can see it clearly over the original TRACTS layer.
Arrange the layers so that subway stations and daycares are the top two layers.

* We will determine which daycare centers lie within these census tracts by using the select by location tool. Navigate to menu item `Selection` >
`Select by location...`. Set the target layer to `DaycareCenters` and the source layer to `NYC_tracts_kids`. Set the selection methods
for target layer features to `are within the source layer feature` and click `OK`.
