## Premise

We are interested at looking at access to daycare centers accross NYC. First, we want to evaluate if daycare centers are located in areas that have high numbers of children under 5 years old. Then we will evaluate which daycare centers are farthest from public transportation (subway stations).

## Questions

How many daycare centers are located within areas with a high number of children under five?
How many daycare centers are located farther than 1/4 mile away from a subway station? Where are those centers (borough, neighborhood)?
How many children do those "far" daycare centers serve?

## Before beginning

Download the data (same as previous week's lab, except Day Care Centers is a geocoded shapefile of the daycare centers as points):

* [Day Care Centers](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/DAYCARECENTERS_NYC_CLEAN.xlsx)
* [NYC_TRACTS_2010](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/2010Tracts-20191025T194412Z-001.zip). 
      **NOTE**: You will have to rename the layer as NYC_TRACTS_2010 in the Catalog window once you open ArcMap.
* [UnderFiveByTract](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/UnderFivePopulation.xls). **NOTE**: You may have to save this file as a CSV after downloading it.
* [Subway Stations] ()

Add the three shapefiles and the csv to the data frame/table of contents.

Join the `UnderFiveByTract` csv to the `NYC_TRACTS_2010` shapefile.

**Note:** Save your map project (as a .mxd) periodically.
